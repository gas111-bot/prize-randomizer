# â›½ GasPump Trading Competition
Welcome to the GasPump Trading Competition prize selection! For more details about the competition, prizes, and rules, please check our [telegram post](https://t.me/gaspump_tv/1184).

## Random Seed
The random seed used for selecting the winners will be determined during a livestream on [@gaspump_tv](https://t.me/gaspump_tv) channel. We will roll 5 dice emojis ðŸŽ² to generate a 5-digit number, which will be used as random seed. This ensures complete transparency and fairness in the winner selection process, because Telegram garantees the randomness of the dice.

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the code:
```bash
python select_winners.py --data data.csv --seed {SEED}
